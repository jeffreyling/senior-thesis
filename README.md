# For readers

High-level concerns:
* how much to introduce for deep learning, representation learning?
* how much to talk about summarization vs deep learning?
* how much to talk about reinforcement learning generally vs specifically?
* where to talk about models in detail: in background or afterward?
Having trouble balancing intuitive explanation and formal descriptions.
* how many figures to include?


Typos to look out for:
* citet vs citep (are citations in parentheses when they should be?)
* missing citations or references (show up as question marks)
* dangling sentences,  incomplete ideas
* notation, terms, or abbreviations that were not defined / inaccurate / are confusing
* anything that looks weird - I may not have looked over everything latex generated!
