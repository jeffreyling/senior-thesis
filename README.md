# For readers

High-level concerns:
* how much to introduce for deep learning, representation learning?
* how many figures to include?
* how much to talk about summarization vs deep learning?
* how much to talk about reinforcement learning generally vs specifically?

Typos to look out for:
* citet vs citep (are citations in parentheses when they should be?)
* missing citations / references (question marks)
* dangling sentences / incomplete ideas
