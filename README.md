# For readers

## High-level concerns
* am I adequately explaning the REINFORCE algorithm? am I doing too much in explaining both reinforcment learning and stochastic computation graphs?
* does anything seem irrelevant or extraneous?

## Typos to look out for
* citet vs citep (are citations in parentheses when they should be?)
* missing citations or references (show up as question marks)
* dangling sentences,  incomplete ideas
* notation, terms, or abbreviations that were not defined / inaccurate / are confusing
* anything that looks weird (I may have missed something in the pdf)

## TODOs
* clean up lit review sections
* include figures
* experiments
  * ROUGE scores
  * error analysis
* bibliography looks terrible
* abstract
* conclusion
