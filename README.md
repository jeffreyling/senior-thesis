# For readers

## High-level concerns
* does anything seem irrelevant or extraneous?
* is any notation or terms confusing?

## Typos to look out for
* notation, terms, or abbreviations that were not defined / inaccurate / are confusing
* citet vs citep (are citations in parentheses when they should be?)
* missing citations or references (show up as question marks)
* dangling sentences,  incomplete ideas
* anything that looks weird (I may have missed something in the pdf)

## TODOs
* clean up lit review sections
* experiments
  * fill in numbers
  * error analysis
* bibliography looks terrible
* abstract
* conclusion
