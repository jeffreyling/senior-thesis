# For readers

## High-level concerns
* how much to talk about summarization vs deep learning?
* Am I talking too much about RL?
* where to talk about models in detail: in background or afterward?
Having trouble balancing intuitive explanation and formal descriptions.

## Typos to look out for
* citet vs citep (are citations in parentheses when they should be?)
* missing citations or references (show up as question marks)
* dangling sentences,  incomplete ideas
* notation, terms, or abbreviations that were not defined / inaccurate / are confusing
* anything that looks weird (I may have missed something in the pdf)

## TODOs
* include figures
* experiments
* bibliography looks terrible
* abstract
